# top1bot

>_Winner winner chicken dinner_

Discord bot that can register a user and keep track of his last Warzone victory by saving it in a JSON file.

Useless therefore essential.

## TODO
* [*] The bot lives
* [*] Register channels
* [ ] Register user's victories
* [ ] Only listen to channels saved in db
* [ ] Admin commands
* [ ] Handle messages / replies
* [ ] Debounce / Queue write requests
* [ ] Max queue size
* [ ] Docs with command list

## Ideas

- If user submits more than 1 top1 in a 15 minute span, ignore request
- Stats ? nb top1 per day / week / month / year ?
- Only Admin can register channels
