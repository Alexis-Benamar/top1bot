# top1bot

>_Winner winner chicken dinner_

Discord bot that can register a user and keep track of his last Warzone victory by saving it in a JSON file.

Useless therefore essential.

## Docs
You can find a list of available commands [here](./DOCS).

## TODO
* [*] The bot lives
* [*] Register channels
* [*] Register user's top1
* [*] Only listen to channels saved in db
* [*] Admin commands
* [*] Handle messages / replies
* [*] Docs with command list
* [ ] Load registered channels at startup instead of checking everytime
* [ ] Refacto using command loader / handler
* [ ] i18

## Ideas

* [*] If user submits more than 1 top1 in a 15 minute span, ignore request
* [ ] Stats ? nb top1 per day / week / month / year ?
  * [ ] command: `last <day, week, month, year, 5 -> last 5 top1>`
* [*] Only Admin can register channels
